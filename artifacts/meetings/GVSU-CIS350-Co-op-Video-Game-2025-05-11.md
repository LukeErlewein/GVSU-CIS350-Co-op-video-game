Game Lore:
The Core is the only device able to generate a safezone and repel the enemies, however it needs energy to startup, protect it until you are able to fully charge it
Game Structure:
Waves of Enemies
Core needs to be filled with energy to finish the game
Certain elite enemies drop power cores to charge a bit of the core energy
At certain core charge percentages (25% 50% 75%) unlock abilities for characters
Player 1:
Crowd Control
Rifle
AOE Damage/Effects
Abilities boost player 2 somehow
Grenade
Enemy slow (Makes the enemies easier to hit for sniper)
Defenses
Player 2:
Precision Damage
Sniper
Single Target Damage
Abilities aid player 1 somehow
Abilities
Piercing shot
Teleport with other player
Turret (Just shoots nearest enemy)
Enemies
Generic grunt
Attacks closest target
Energy cell holder
Higher health, can only be hurt by the sniper
Slower than generic grunt
Attacks closest player and ignores core
Speeder
Faster with less health (Easier for player 1 to take care of.)
Attacks the core
Boss monster
Shows up at certain moments (time based or core charge based)
Super slow tons of health
Attacks closest player or core
Healer
Heals enemies and has decent health but no attack power.
Assassin
Only attacks the player

Teamwork:
Only player 1 can pick up the energy cells
Only Player 2 can deliver the killing blow to the enemies that drop cells
Definitely add more teamwork elements
