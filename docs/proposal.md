# Introduction

In this game, there are two players that each need to defend a power core that is providing the last
power to their desolate wasteland that they call home. They will need to defend against hordes of
ruthless enemies by using special abilities to their advantage.

# Anticipated Technologies

We will be using the Godot game engine to be able to code our game.

# Method/Approach

We will be tackling features as they come along according to our project timeline. Each of these 
features will be seperated onto their own branch and then once one programmer is happy with the feature
they will merge it into the main branch with detailed commit messages detailing all major changes 
that they made in that branch. This means only certain aspects will be added with each commit.

# Estimated Timeline
We have a excel document that details a project time line for each aspect of the game. such as 

# Anticipated Problems

- Multiplayer aspect.
- Performance of computer with lots of entities.
- Time constraints with shortened class time.


Remember this is a living document is expected to be changed as you make progress on your project.
